---

Ever since I was a first-grader, it has always felt like I had to succeed. Mom and dad used to tell me how much better of a life I had versus what they had. And the sacrifices they had to make to get us here.

That’s the middle-class family that brought me up. My grandparents were farmers who fought the war. My parents moved to the city for university and stayed here for work. So I grew up a Hanoian knowing little about the countryside.

Wartime taught us to yearn for success and discriminate against failure. Because success meant, after all, stability, food and shelter. Things we didn’t have much by then. To fail was to die.

And so we fought.

Success was so important that I’ve never felt I could have time to rest. A first-grader kid worked hard to get into the so-called “gifted class”. A high schooler desperately tried to maintain “good” marks. An economics student hopelessly found himself looking for a job, with a mediocre degree, during an economic recession.

12+4 years a student, those classes and exams haunted me into my dreams even until I was 27-28 years of age. In one of these silly dreams, I was being frightened to know that I somehow forgot to attend the final exam day. In several others, faceless teachers were yelling at me for not doing enough homework or preparing for new lessons.

I’m not here to blame the education system. But what a shame that that happened to almost every kid I knew as friends.

All that to ensure future success?

And surely I must have got enough to succeed! Enduring all those pains in all those years. Haven’t I?

Yet I have failed. I have failed in so many ways that it’s hard to recount them all in just a few paragraphs. Nothing could describe the feelings. It’s wreaking havoc. From business to relationships to friendships.

At some point, I was all at once fighting with my girlfriend, having troubles with my parents, having been fired from my first job, and losing my close friend’s money. It was embarrassing.

A few months into 2013, I’d lost almost everything, financially and emotionally. A friend helped me get a job at a private company 6 months later. If you asked, it felt like a million years in torture, like Dr. Strange vs. Dormammu in endless looped time — although my act was nowhere close to being heroic.

And time after time, I pretended that I was okay, that somehow I could still get up and fight back. Each time I got on Facebook and bragged about myself, the new friends that I made, the job titles, the scholarship, the startup grant, etc.

I was delusional.

I felt empty. It was not me under my own skin, except it was. It was all me -- crying secretly at home, at work, and in front of those few friends that I’d made — and lost. On one occasion, I even ranted at an HR friend when she told me I got rejected because the manager she worked with received negative feedback upon contacting my first workplace. She’s never referred me again.

It’s the hopelessness that was driving me day after day.

So I’m sorry if I have hurt!

I’m so thankful and humble for all the help and mercy that everyone gave me along the way. Without you all, I wouldn’t have survived. Not just the ones who remain by my side, but also you who have parted ways.

Is it true that I have never had enough time to care for anyone or anything? Or so I thought. Even for myself...

I remember questioning myself whether I should just commit suicide.

Would it end?

It’s both hilarious and scary now that I’d even had the thought.

Back then it was nothing but scary.

Anyway, I’ve written this piece to remind myself that that was all part of the journey. That success is not a destination nor the end. It’s just a checkpoint, like any other checkpoint when you play video games and hit **Save**.

It's feedback for me going down my own path.

Failure is no different.
